# DFA_ComputerTheory
The C++ code created by UNIFEI students João Victor Silveira Ribeiro and João Pedro Pereira Magalhães for an evaluation assignment proposed by their professor involved the implementation of a deterministic finite automaton (DFA). 
The code was thoroughly tested and validated using a variety of test cases to ensure its correctness and functionality.
